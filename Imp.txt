FOODU is a groundbreaking food delivery startup that addresses three critical issues: food wastage, zero hunger & zero deaths. Since its launch in November 2022, we have fed over 100,000 homeless people by collecting surplus food from restaurants, ensuring it reaches those in need. This initiative not only saves lives but also contributes to the global goal of zero hunger. By reducing food wastage, we play a vital role in environmental sustainability. Beyond the social impact, we have built a profitable business model, generating employment and introducing innovative features that set it apart from other food delivery companies.




Our mission at FOODU addresses these multifaceted issues, aiming to create a more equitable food system that reduces waste and provides for the hungry.

Social Factors - The urban-rural divide plays a significant role, with urban centres experiencing food surpluses while rural areas often face scarcity. Poverty is another critical factor, as many people simply cannot afford basic meals. Additionally, there is a widespread lack of awareness about the extent of food wastage and its direct impact on hunger, leading to insufficient action from both individuals and organisations.

Cultural Factors - Cultural practices and norms often exacerbate food wastage. For instance, during social events and celebrations, food is frequently over-prepared and discarded. There is also a cultural stigma around consuming leftovers or donating excess food, which leads to perfectly good food being thrown away rather than being redistributed to those in need.

Political Factors - Politically, the issue is compounded by inadequate policies and ineffective regulations regarding food redistribution. Many governments lack the necessary frameworks to facilitate the easy and safe donation of surplus food, and bureaucratic barriers often hinder efforts to redirect excess food to those who need it most.

Economic Factors - Economically, inefficiencies in the food supply chain, from production to distribution, result in significant food loss. The cost of redistributing surplus food, including collection, storage, and transportation, can be prohibitively high, limiting the scalability of such initiatives. Market dynamics also prioritise profit margins, often overlooking the importance of addressing food insecurity and hunger.




At FOODU, we serve a wide range of communities, primarily focusing on vulnerable groups such as the homeless, low-income families, and marginalised populations who struggle with food insecurity. Our startup also engages with local restaurants, food vendors, and volunteers who play crucial roles in its mission.

Community Engagement - We directly impact the homeless and low-income families by redistributing surplus food, providing them with nutritious meals. Since the inception, we have fed over 100,000 homeless individuals, addressing urgent hunger needs and mitigating food insecurity in these communities.

To achieve this, we collaborate with local restaurants and food vendors, encouraging them to donate excess food. This not only helps reduce food wastage but also strengthens ties between businesses and their communities, fostering a sense of shared responsibility.

Volunteers, delivery boys and local activists are also key players in operations, participating in food collection, distribution, and awareness campaigns. Their involvement creates a grassroots movement, empowering communities to contribute.

Cultural Storytelling and Organizing - We actively engage the community in cultural storytelling and organising through events, campaigns, and educational programs. These initiatives often feature personal stories from those who have benefited from FOODU’s services, creating a powerful narrative that highlights the cultural and social significance of reducing food wastage.

Additionally, FOODU’s awareness programs emphasise the cultural value of food and the importance of community-driven solutions. By fostering these narratives, we not only address immediate needs but also build a culture of sustainability, empathy, and social responsibility within the communities it serves.




The greatest impact of FOODU lies in its innovative approach to tackling three critical global issues: food wastage, hunger and deaths. By redistributing surplus food to feed over 100,000 homeless individuals and low-income families, we not only provide immediate relief to those in need but also significantly reduce food waste. This dual impact aligns with global goals like zero hunger and environmental sustainability, setting a new standard for social entrepreneurship by proving that businesses can be both profitable and socially responsible.

Expanding Impact - Our new initiatives aim to exponentially increase its reach, with the goal of directly impacting over millions of people. This will be achieved by expanding our food redistribution efforts to new regions and increasing collaborations with local and international food vendors, restaurants, and community organisations. Through technological advancements, we will improve the efficiency of our food collection and distribution processes, ensuring that more people receive the meals they need.

Global Vision and Indirect Impact - Indirectly, we aim to influence billions more by raising global awareness about food wastage, hunger and deaths. Through educational campaigns, social media outreach, and community engagement programs, we plan to inspire behavioural changes in food consumption and waste management. Our vision is to impact the entire world, fostering a culture of sustainability, empathy, and social responsibility.

By addressing these issues at both local and global levels, we not only continue to make a direct impact on those in need but also catalyse broader social and environmental change, striving for a world where no one goes hungry and food resources are used efficiently and responsibly.




FOODU employs an intersectional approach to address food insecurity and wastage, ensuring that its initiatives are inclusive and responsive to various social dimensions including race, class, gender, age, and disability.

Race and Ethnicity - We serve a diverse range of racial and ethnic groups by partnering with local organisations and food vendors across different regions. This inclusivity ensures that food distribution respects cultural preferences and addresses the specific needs of various communities.

Class - Our core focus is on supporting low-income and homeless individuals, thereby addressing economic disparities. By providing access to nutritious meals, we help mitigate the effects of poverty and ensure that people from economically disadvantaged backgrounds receive essential resources.

Gender - We are committed to gender inclusivity, ensuring that all genders, including women facing challenges such as single motherhood or domestic violence, benefit from our services. The organisation also promotes gender diversity within its workforce and volunteer base, fostering an equitable environment.

Age - We impact spans of all age groups. Collaborations with schools, senior centres, and community groups allow us to address the specific needs of children, the elderly, and other age-related groups, ensuring that everyone, regardless of age, has access to nutritious food.

Disability - We prioritise accessibility for individuals with disabilities. By working with disability organisations and implementing accessible food distribution processes, we ensure that people with physical or cognitive disabilities receive the support they need.

FOODU addresses the diverse needs of the communities and ensuring that no one is excluded from its benefits.




FOODU’s innovative strategies and inclusive practices offer fresh opportunities to tackle food insecurity and wastage, setting a new benchmark for social entrepreneurship.

Innovative Business Model - Our model is a breakthrough in blending profitability with social impact. By partnering with restaurants and food vendors to collect surplus food, we not only reduce waste, but also do normal food deliveries as users place any orders and when users find homeless people and post them on our platform and for that, they get a 10 rupees money reward in their FOODU wallet. This approach demonstrates that a social enterprise can operate successfully while making a substantial difference.

Technology Integration - We partner with restaurants and add them to our platform. Where they can easily make more sales by normal orders, and additionally we have an offer for them where they have to pack the available surplus food if they have, and for per 1kg food we give them 10 rupees. This tech-driven strategy sets a new standard for social enterprises, showcasing how technology can effectively address complex social issues.

Community Engagement - Our model emphasises active community involvement, creating a sense of shared responsibility and purpose. By engaging local volunteers and delivery boys on our platform, where we add them as surplus food delivery partners for per successful delivery they earn 10 rupees. FOODU highlights the power of collective action in solving food insecurity. This collaborative approach fosters a community-driven solution that involves everyone in the mission to reduce hunger and waste.
